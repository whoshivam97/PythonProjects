In this video, you will learn how to do batch operations with Python.
So what do I mean by that?
Well, let's look at the current state of the program.
So the program is asking the user three times for entering input.
So we have three functions here.
But as we mentioned, this is not sustainable.
So what we want is to write the input function only once and somehow tell Python to execute it multiple
times.
So how do we do that?
We only need the input function once here and then we make some space in here and we use a while.
Loop.
So this starts with this while keywords and then make a space and you put a condition.
The conditions should be a true statement.
So is to greater than one.

So that's part here for white spaces is is indentation and it is part of the syntax.
So when you write this word keyword.
Whatever comes down here, all the code is indented under that while keywords.

So what is true?
True is a Boolean is a data type.
A Boolean is like strings and lists.
So that was a string data type.
This is a Boolean data type.
And this here is a typical use of this data type.
You can also have false here.
False.
But if we rerun the program.
Nothing will happen because false is false.

So none of these lines will be executed.

Therefore, the end version is one to execute this.
